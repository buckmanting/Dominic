## Versioning
We use Semver for our versioning. It is a great way to keep our versioning easy to understand. As well as this it allows developers who use Dominic to upgrade to newer versions with conifdence that things won't break ðŸ™‚. There is a wonderful explaination of and reasoning for Semver over at the [Springer Nature Frontend Playbook](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook/blob/main/git/semver.md)
