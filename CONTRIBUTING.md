# Contributing
If you're here because you want to contribute then that is amazing üòç. Thank you for wanting to get involved with this project and helping to improve the community!

## Where do I start
There are a couple of ways you can get started contributing to Dominic. If you've found a Bug or you would like to request or add a new feature, then you're best [opening a new issue](https://github.com/springerBuck/Dominic/issues). If you have general feedback or you have an idea you're best of [opening a new discussion](https://github.com/springerBuck/Dominic/discussions). The best way to get started is to choose one of these paths. There may be ideas that are beyond the scope of Dominic. For example, if you have this great idea to add a new feature that would convert all the text in the UI to emojis of Cats üêà. There is certainly a use case for that somewhere, but that's not functionality Dominic would need. By opening an issue or starting a discussion you can save yourself a lot of effort.

### Opening an issue
There are two templates available, one to report a bug and another to request a feature. If you notice a bug, please raise a bug. If there is a cool feature you would like Dominic to have, raise a new feature request üëç. Both of these have a structure already in place for you to follow.

When raising a bug it is important to get as much detail in there as possible. The more detail the easier it will be to diagnose.

When raising a feature request please explain your idea as clearly and concisely as possible. The easier it is to understand your idea, the easier it will be to move forward. The important points to remember when raising an feature request are **scope** and **scale**. Does your idea fit the scope of Dominic? Dominic is supposed to be a simple library for UI testing partials and views. The definition of what is "simple" and what is required to adequately test will evolve. You might have an idea that is not currently seen as within Dominic's scope. It might be the case that it is in the future. Please don't be disheartened if your idea is rejected or considered out of scope for the time being. Your effort and consideration will be appreciated regardless. No idea will be rejected without discussion.
