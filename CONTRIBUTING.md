## Versioning
We use Semver for our versioning. It is a great way to keep our versioning easy to understand. As well as this it allows developers who use Dominic to upgrade to newer versions with conifdence that things won't break 🙂. There is a wonderful explaination of and reasoning for Semver over at the [Springer Nature Frontend Playbook](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook/blob/main/git/semver.md)
